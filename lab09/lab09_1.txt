a. How effective is the linear regression approach to the problem?

I think it does the job but not with accuracy.

b. Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss.

I think log loss is better in classification when L2 is better when dealing with quantities.

c. Task 2: Explain how effective logistic regression is compared with linear regression.

Log regression is much more effective as it has categorical nature.

d. Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy and what hyperparameters you used to get them.

learning_rate=0.000009
steps=10000,batch_size=650
AUC= .81
Accuracy= .79
