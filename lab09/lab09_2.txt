a. Why are we regularizing with respect to sparsity?

Because we wish to increase sparsity. Doing so, we decrease our parameters and the model will not over fit while 
being efficient with less parameters.

b. How does L1 regularization increase sparsity?

By limiting, size of parameters, and eliminating parameters that are less used.

c. Task 1: Here, just report the best log loss value / model size you can get and what gamma value you used to get them.
reg val: .75 reg 
model size: of 587 
og loss: of .25.
