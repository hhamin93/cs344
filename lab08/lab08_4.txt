1. What good did the K-fold validation do in this exercise?

K-fold allowed us to validate data relatively reliably with relatively small data pool.

2. Chollet claims that it would be problematic to use data values with “wildly different ranges”. Why is this?

because it will cause values with bigger values to have more impact when it really does not have more information than the smaller values.
It does not predict better than the smaller values.

3. Chollet also claims that smaller datasets “prefer” smaller networks. Do you agree? Explain your answer.

I agree as larger networks trained on smaller datasets will be so specialized that they will not be able to fit other sets of data.

4. Try networks with one more and one less hidden layer, and wider or narrower layers.
