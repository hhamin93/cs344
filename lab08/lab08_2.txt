1. 

The pearson correlation coefficient shows the closeness of the two factors in ratio. It shows how predictive one factor can be to another.
one example could be from excercise 1, between rooms and bedrooms, (0.9), a very strong correlation. Which makes sense as more room there will be, more bedrooms.

2. 

Task 1:

minimal_features = ["median_income","rooms_per_person",]
learning_rate=0.05, steps=500, batch_size=600
RMSE = 84.33

Task 2:

training_examples["In_SF_or_LA"] = training_examples["latitude"].apply(
    lambda l: 1.0 if (33 <= l <=35) or  (37 <= l <= 39) else 0.0)
validation_examples["In_SF_or_LA"] = validation_examples["latitude"].apply(
    lambda l: 1.0 if (33 <= l <=35) or  (37 <= l <= 39) else 0.0)
synthetic_features = ["median_income","In_SF_or_LA",
]
synthetic_training_examples = training_examples[synthetic_features]
synthetic_validation_examples = validation_examples[synthetic_features]
_ = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.03,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    training_examples=synthetic_training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=synthetic_validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

RMSE:83.84

Both beat the baseline
