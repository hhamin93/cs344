Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?

the matrix give data set of digits and symbols that are not digits and as the symbols are plotted
to digits they are told right or wrong.

Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ 
from the Keras example given in class? 
Report any improvements you can make over the baseline testset accuracy for this task.

It looked to me like c and python to me, with kera being python and tensorflow being c. Users can enjoy simple 
architecture from keras not having to worry about much on hidden layers, parameters to the functions, feature colums, and so on. 
With tensorflow, however, we can control all these details.

accuracyon test set : 0.89.

Task 3: What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps?

10 steps: they are not defined in shapes 
1000 step: have defined shapes and patterns.
