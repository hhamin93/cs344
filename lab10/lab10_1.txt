1. Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?

I would prefer keras models. I think keras is more shortened and simple.

2. Tasks 1 & 2: Report your best hyper-parameter settings and their resulting performance on the testing dataset.

Task 1&2:

 learning_rate=0.001,
               steps=3000,
               batch_size=100,
               hidden_units=[10, 10]
 RMSE:         104.53
